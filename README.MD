# MITUPLOADER
Batch upload files to multiple MIT App Inventor accounts.

### How it works:
- uploads ***ALL*** files in current directory with **.aia** extension
- uploads to users listed in users.txt located in current directory

### Example users.txt:
```text
user0:AAA-BBB-CCC-DDD
user1:AAA-BBB-CCC-DDD
user2:AAA-BBB-CCC-DDD
```
